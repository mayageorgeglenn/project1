                <p>I’m a senior at UT Austin studying Statistics & Data Science, with a breadth of experiences across M&A investing, AI product and data science, and growth strategy. On campus, I lead Texas Venture Group, managing partnerships with top VCs and startups through events and projects. This fall, I'm joining Palantir in New York as a Deployment Strategist. Outside of work, I’m into wellness, great food and coffee, and outdoor activities.</p>
