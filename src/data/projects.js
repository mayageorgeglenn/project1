Drawing on primary research, clinical literature, and market analysis, it maps the emerging landscape of diagnostics, preventive interventions, and AI-assisted health optimization. The work critically evaluates the gap between scientific evidence and commercial claims, and argues for a regulatory framework that can keep pace with rapid biotech development while remaining accessible beyond affluent early adopters.`,

Integrated geospatial data (station proximity, land use), weather feeds, and historical ridership to achieve a 23% reduction in rebalancing cost simulations compared to the heuristic baseline. The model outputs feed a greedy dispatch optimizer that assigns trucks to rebalancing routes in real time. All feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation were documented end-to-end for reproducibility.`,
